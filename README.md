# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time computer vision–based application designed to enhance road safety by monitoring a driver's alertness. The system detects signs of drowsiness using facial landmarks and eye-blink patterns and triggers instant alerts to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

## Features
- Real-time driver monitoring using webcam
- Eye-blink and facial landmark–based drowsiness detection
- Instant audio and visual alerts upon detecting fatigue
- Continuous video stream analysis for proactive safety
- Lightweight and efficient implementation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Deep Learning
- Dlib (Facial Landmark Detection)
- NumPy
- Webcam (for live video feed)

## How It Works
1. Captures live video frames from the webcam.
2. Detects the driver’s face and extracts facial landmarks.
3. Calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to identify prolonged eye closure.
4. Flags drowsiness when EAR falls below a predefined threshold.
5. Triggers an alarm to alert the driver in real time.

## Applications
- Driver safety systems
- Smart vehicle monitoring
- Accident prevention systems
- Real-time surveillance applications

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with mobile or in-vehicle systems
- Yawn detection and head pose estimation
- Cloud-based alert logging
- Improved accuracy using advanced deep learning models
